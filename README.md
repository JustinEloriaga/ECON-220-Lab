**Institution:** Emory University  
**Professor:** Justin Eloriaga

## üìã Course Overview

This repository contains laboratory materials and assignments for ECON 220 (Data Science for Economists) at Emory University. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to probability, statistics, and data analysis techniques specifically tailored for economics applications.

### Course Objectives
- Develop proficiency in statistical analysis and data interpretation
- Master probability theory and statistical inference
- Apply statistical methods to economic data and research
- Gain hands-on experience with statistical programming
- Build foundation for advanced econometric analysis

## üìö Topics Covered

### Core Statistical Concepts
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  - Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range)
  - Data visualization and graphical analysis

- **Probability Theory**
  - Sample spaces and events
  - Conditional probability and independence
  - Bayes' rule and law of total probability
  - Discrete and continuous probability distributions

- **Statistical Distributions**
  - Normal distribution
  - Binomial distribution
  - Poisson distribution
  - t-distribution, chi-square, F-distribution

- **Statistical Inference**
  - Point estimation and confidence intervals
  - Hypothesis testing (z-tests, t-tests)
  - Type I and Type II errors
  - p-values and statistical significance

- **Regression Analysis**
  - Simple linear regression
  - Correlation analysis
  - Least squares estimation
  - Introduction to multiple regression

### Programming and Software
- Statistical programming fundamentals
- Data manipulation and cleaning
- Creating visualizations and graphs
- Interpreting statistical output

## üõ†Ô∏è Software and Tools

- **Primary Software:** [R/Python/Stata - specify which is used]
- **Development Environment:** [RStudio/Jupyter/etc.]
- **Visualization Tools:** ggplot2, matplotlib, or similar
- **Data Formats:** CSV, Excel, text files

## üìà Datasets

The repository includes various economic datasets for analysis:
- **Macroeconomic indicators** (GDP, inflation, unemployment)
- **Labor market data** (wages, employment statistics)
- **Financial market data** (stock prices, interest rates)
- **Survey data** (consumer confidence, demographic information)
- **Cross-sectional and time series data**
